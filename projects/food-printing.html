    <h1>Nutrition Printing System for Elderly</h1>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Many elderly individuals living alone face nutritional imbalance due to difficulties in cooking, chewing, and digestion. This leads to risks of malnutrition, reduced immunity, and overall health deterioration.</p>

    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>We developed a 3D printing-based nutrition system that allows customized meals based on individual nutritional needs. The food is soft-textured, easy to swallow, and modularly printable in portion-controlled formats.</p>

    <h2>Team & My Role</h2>
    <p>As part of the EWB (Engineers Without Borders) design team, I contributed to ideation, 3D CAD modeling, printing test runs, and user interviews with nursing home staff. I focused on practical implementation and mechanism feasibility.</p>

    <h2>Technology Used</h2>
    <p>- 3D Printing (FDM, food-safe nozzle)</p>
    <p>- Fusion360 modeling</p>
    <p>- Basic nutrient formulation strategy using portion calibration</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>This project was submitted to the 2024 James Dyson Award and exhibited in the KAIST design showcase. It sparked further discussions on the role of food tech in elderly care.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project allowed me to explore how engineering can address human-centered needs, especially when aligned with meaningful, tangible outcomes. It was a balance between technical feasibility and real social impact.</p>
